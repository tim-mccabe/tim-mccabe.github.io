# Data and Machine Learning Personal Blog

## Intro

This repository is where I have created a website to host all of my projects in a consumable way. I used a bootstrap template to create the base of the website. 
Not all the projects code is in this repository. On each web page, there is a link the specific repository where the raw code is located. 

## Tasks Performed

This blog is a place where I can showcase Data Science and Machine Learning skills. Some of the projects posted are from the time I spent in the classroom but most have been independent. 

Some of the skills showcased on the blog:

  * Machine Learning
  * Deep Learning
  * Neural Networks
  * Data Analytics
  * Web Scarping
  * API mapping
  
## Conclusion

Hopefully this blog serves as a place where I can continue to post about interesting data sets, and showcase new skills as my career progresses.
